In this folder, there are three txt files. They are the input files to generate the BBB results.

1. counts_fm.txt [this is the family level analysis input file]
2. counts_ord.txt [this is the order level analysis input file]
3. counts_whole_angio.txt [this is the whole angiosperm analysis input file; inside the file, is ten random repeats of the same clade]

The first column is time bins (each unit is Ma, size is 2.5). The first row are the names of the clades.
