Here are three txt files of the result of each level, and a merged excel file for all levels.

The detail documentation of the output column names please refer to the documentation of the BBB programme source code: https://github.com/dsilvestro/rootBBB/tree/master 

Note that the first column's name is always 'family', but it just the default output name; the exact meaning is the name of the clade, ie, if calculating the orders, then should be 'order'. (It had no impact of the result itself)
