'00_Calibration': the list of calibration we used in MCMCTree from the results of BBB analysis.

'01_Streategy1_SkewT', '01_Streategy2_SoftboundUniform_0.025', '01_Streategy3_HardboundUniform' are three folder contains results from MCMCTree analyses. All MCMCTree analyses are conducted by the MCMCTree programme from PAML package (version 4.10.7, see source code: https://github.com/abacus-gene/paml/releases/tag/4.10.7), and related analysing process following: https://github.com/sabifo4/Tutorial_MCMCtree.

In each '01_Strategy...' folder, there are two subfolders: '00_Prior' and '01_Posterior'. 

In '00_Prior', there are files:
	1. '.tsv', contains statistics about all chains (if has 'FILT', means statistics from filtered chains only, details about how the analytical process see the https://github.com/sabifo4/Tutorial_MCMCtree; same as below) 
	2. convergence plot pdf (if has 'filt', means statistics from filtered chains only)
	3. '.tree', prior tree generated by MCMCTree programme.

In '01_Posterior', there are files:
	1. '.tsv', contains statistics about all chains (if has 'FILT', means statistics from filtered chains only) 
	2. convergence plot pdf (if has 'filt', means statistics from filtered chains only)
	3. '.tree', prior tree generated by MCMCTree programme.
	4. 'multipic' pdf, the user-specified prior vs effective prior vs posterior plots of each calibrated node.
